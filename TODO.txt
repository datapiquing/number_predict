To Do

1. Bug: Less data rows retrieved in dictionary than in raw data due to lack of reflectivity value at 360 degrees
    - hence the results of 2 rows merge/overwrite when splitting into buckets
    
    
Note:
# Could copy an python script to ev3 initially and give permissions (stackoverflow 68335)
# If creating a file to send within the same Python program, call 'subprocess.run' outside
# the 'with' block used to open the file (or call '.close() on the file first if not using
# a 'with' block). This ensures the file is flushed to disk from Python.
