# Lego Mindstorms EV3: Machine Learning
## Number Prediction
This project uses the Lego model, created with the Mindstorms EV3 robotics kit (31313), to predict which wooden number 
(0 to 9) has been placed on a platform beneath a light sensor supplied with the kit.
This is achieved by creating a machine learning model from the light reflectivity readings of each number as they
rotate beneath the sensor.
